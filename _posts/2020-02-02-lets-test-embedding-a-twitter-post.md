So let's see how this comes out...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Day 2 of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MWE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MWE</a>: &quot;I Do Not Want What I Haven&#39;t Got&quot; by Sin√©ad O&#39;connor. Would not have given this any play when it came out, except track 2 where she sings over the &quot;Funky Drummer&quot; break.   Now that I&#39;m a grown-ass man, I can appreciated this.  Love her voice.</p>&mdash; Paul Klump (@p_k_n_y) <a href="https://twitter.com/p_k_n_y/status/1224060909682921474?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2020</a></blockquote>
