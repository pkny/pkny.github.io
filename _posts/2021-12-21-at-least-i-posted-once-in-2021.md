So every year I think to myself, "This will be the year I start actually blogging stuff".  And at the end of every year, that never happens.  It' like I'm getting a jump on New Years resolutions in some sense, but I want to be less lazy, and use this blog to get thoughts out of head.

So while today is the start of season winter, I submit to you abut the metaphorical winter we've been living through my entire lifespan, with the hope that I'll be around long enough to see the spring.
