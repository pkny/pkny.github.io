With the end of 2021 almost here (and a goal to blog more), I figured I'd put together a short playlist of songs I've gone back to over and over again in 2021.  To make life easier, I made a [playlist in Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/62SSXQLxbGDh0hqENXniCt?si=9bq8Q6mXS1yCOSwSapy2TQ).  However,I'd suggest that if you like any of the tracks above, then go to each artist's [Bandcamp Page](https:www.bandcamp.com) to put some change in their pockets.  

As an addendum, I'm using this post to see if I can embed code to make this Spotify playist appear directly in the post, per the info on [this page](https://github.com/andriannp/spotify-embed-on-Jekyll):

{% include spotifyplaylist.html id=page.spotifyplaylist %}

{% include JB/setup %}
