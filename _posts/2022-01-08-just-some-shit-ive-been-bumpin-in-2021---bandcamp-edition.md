So my man [Verigo Clinic](https://bandcamp.com/vertigoclinic) hipped me to this new site called [BNDCMPR](https://bndcmpr.co/), where you can make playlist with Bandcamp links.  So without any further delay, here is a [slightly altered](http://pkny.github.io/2021/12/24/just-some-shit-ive-been-bumpin-in-2021) version of the Spotify playlist I previously posted, but leaning towards the tracks I played via Bandcamp over 2021.  Also this gives me a chance to test out their embedded code; if it doesn't work, then just [click here](https://bndcmpr.co/6c9185e7)!
