Following the links on [this page](https://github.com/dommmel/jekyll-youtube), I added a plugin to embed a YouTube video in my posts.

So let's test it.

First, here's an example of how to embed a video of the [Lucifer's Friend](https://www.discogs.com/Lucifers-Friend-Lucifers-Friend/master/90119) album I gave a run today:

```text
{% youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y9AJ4HVAQg" %}
```

And if all goes well, the video should be embedded below:

{% youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-y9AJ4HVAQg" %}



{% include JB/setup %}
