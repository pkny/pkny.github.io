Following the links on [this page](https://github.com/dommmel/jekyll-youtube), I added a plugin to embed a YouTube video in my posts.

<b>Update: while this plugin works in a locally served Jekyll instance, it won't work with GitHub, so links will have to be embedded a different way...</b>

So let's test it.

First, here's an example of how to embed a video of the [Lucifer's Friend](https://www.discogs.com/Lucifers-Friend-Lucifers-Friend/master/90119) album I gave a run today, using the embed code posted by YT:


```css
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L1Kg0_wDFig" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

And if all goes well, the video should be embedded below:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L1Kg0_wDFig" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
