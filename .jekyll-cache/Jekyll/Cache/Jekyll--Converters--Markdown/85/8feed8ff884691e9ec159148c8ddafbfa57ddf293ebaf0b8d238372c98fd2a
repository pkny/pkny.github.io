I"R<p>…because I had no real content to start with!  After lollygagging for a long time, I’m finally going to use this space to capture my thoughts/ideas/nerd excursions, while I figure out the ins and outs of Jekyll.  So please bear with me; the layouts might be a bit iffy in the beginning, but I hope the content will be quality.</p>
