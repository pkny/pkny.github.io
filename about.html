<p>My name is Paul Klump, born and raised in upstate NY, but now living in NJ. I pay the bills as an IT professional, but it's only as of 2016 that I've decided to set up a blog. I know I'm blowing a hole in my nerd cred, but there wasn't much I wanted to share with the outside world up until recently. Now I just wanted a place to record the thoughts in my head on topics like technology, music, fitness, religion, politics, life, etc while learning about blogging/CMS/markup languages, and other web technologies.</p>

<p>I've kept most of my web/social media presence on the DL, but here are my more public expressions on the Internet:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://twitter.com/p_k_n_y">Twitter</a> — a good way to make contact</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pkny">GitHub</a> — not much there now, but as time goes on, you never know...</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.discogs.com/seller/pkny/profile">Discogs seller's page</a> — I've been pairing down my record collection.  Do us both a favor, and take some records off of my hands</li>
  <li><a href="http://last.fm/user/pk_ny">Last.FM</a> — want to know what music I've been listening to?  Here's a good place to start</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.wfmu.org/profile/429694040/">WFMU</a> — just the best damn independent radio station on planet Earth. If I'm awake, I'm usually listening either OTA or OTW.</li>
</ul>
